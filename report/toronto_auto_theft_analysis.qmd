# Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of auto theft patterns in Toronto and their relationship to demographic factors using police-reported theft data and the 2021 Canadian Census. By combining these datasets through spatial interpolation techniques, we identified significant patterns and correlations between socioeconomic factors and auto theft incidents across Toronto's 158 neighborhoods.

The analysis addresses the key challenge of integrating datasets with different geographic units: auto theft data organized by Toronto's official neighborhoods and census data organized by Forward Sortation Areas (FSAs). Through areal-weighted interpolation and rigorous data processing, we've created a unified dataset that reveals meaningful insights about the relationship between community characteristics and auto theft incidents.

## Key Findings

1.  **Concentrated Spatial Risk**: Auto theft is highly concentrated in specific Toronto neighborhoods. West Humber-Clairville (001) has the highest absolute theft count, while areas like Rexdale-Kipling (004) exhibit the highest theft rates per 1,000 residents, highlighting distinct risk zones.

2.  **Socioeconomic and Commuting Links**: Theft patterns are complexly linked to socioeconomic factors. Higher rates of commuting by car and lower educational attainment correlate with increased total thefts. Conversely, higher postsecondary education levels and more renters are associated with lower theft rates per capita.

3.  **Vulnerable Locations**: Parking lots (commercial and apartment) and 'outside' premises (streets, driveways) are predominant locations for auto theft, accounting for a significant majority of incidents.

4.  **Clear Temporal Patterns**: Thefts peak during night hours (10 PM - 6 AM). There's a slight seasonal increase in Autumn, and incidents are more frequent on weekdays, particularly Thursdays, compared to weekends.

## Data Processing and Integration

### ETL Pipeline Development
A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline was developed to process and integrate the datasets, structured as a Python package with modular components:

1. **Auto Theft Pipeline** (`auto_theft_pipeline.py`)
   - Cleaned and validated data
   - Standardized temporal information (fixed inconsistent timestamps)
   - Verified geospatial coordinates (ensured all coordinates fall within Toronto's boundaries)
   - Generated derived features (time bins, seasons, weekend indicators) for possible future insurance risk modeling
   - Masked sensitive claimant information while preserving analytical value

2. **Census Pipeline** (`census_pipeline.py`)
   - Processed demographic data for Toronto FSAs using efficient targeted loading
   - Standardized variables and units
   - Filtered relevant socioeconomic indicators
   - Applied appropriate data types for memory optimization

3. **Geospatial Pipeline** (`geospatial_pipeline.py`)
   - Mapped FSAs to Toronto's 158 neighborhoods using spatial overlay operations
   - Calculated spatial intersections and percent overlap for each FSA-neighborhood pair
   - Computed area weights for interpolation
   - Created a persistent mapping table stored as `toronto_hoods_fsa_overlap.parquet`

### Data Quality Improvements

1. **Auto Theft Claims Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicate claim entries (reduced from 68,063 to 61,534 unique events)
   - Fixed timestamp issues (all original timestamps were set to 05:00:00; replaced with hour values from separate columns)
   - Validated geographic coordinates (ensuring latitude between 43.5-44.0, longitude between -79.8-79.0)
   - Imputed missing neighborhood information using modal neighborhoods
   - Dropped 363 records (~0.5%) with no usable geospatial information
   - Removed 19 events with occurrence dates significantly earlier than the claim reporting period
   - Standardized categorical variables using category data types
   - Verified claim status and recovery information where available

2. **Census Data Preparation**
   - Efficiently loaded only Toronto FSA data (identified line ranges 8286-8426)
   - Consolidated relevant socioeconomic indicators from hundreds of available variables
   - Standardized variable names and applied appropriate data types
   - Handled special codes for data suppression, reliability flags, and not applicable values
   - Improved memory efficiency by converting text columns to categorical data types

3. **Spatial Integration**
   - Implemented **areal-weighted interpolation** to bridge differences in geographic units
   - Created a mapping between FSAs and neighborhoods with percentage overlap calculations
   - Applied spatial weights to distribute census data from FSAs to neighborhoods
   - Validated spatial relationships through visualization and logical checks
   - Generated a unified dataset joining auto theft counts with interpolated demographic data

# Analysis Results

## Auto Theft Patterns

### Temporal Patterns

#### Time of Day

![Distribution of Auto Thefts by Time of Day](images/time_occurrence.png)

The analysis of theft incidents by hour of occurrence reveals distinct patterns:

- **Night Hours (10PM-6AM)**: Highest incident rates with 23,021 incidents (37.6% of all thefts)
- **Morning (6AM-12PM)**: 12,452 incidents (20.3%)
- **Afternoon (12PM-6PM)**: 14,874 incidents (24.3%)
- **Evening (6PM-10PM)**: 10,849 incidents (17.8%)

This distribution suggests that vehicles are most vulnerable when left unattended overnight, particularly in residential areas and parking lots. The relatively high afternoon rate reflects thefts from commercial areas and workplace parking lots during business hours.

#### Weekly Patterns

![Distribution of Auto Thefts by Day of Week](images/dayofweek_occurrence.png)

The day-of-week analysis shows an interesting distribution:

- **Thursday**: Highest incident rate (9,429 incidents)
- **Weekends (Saturday-Sunday)**: Lowest incident rates
- **Weekday average**: Approximately 9,000 incidents per day

The lower weekend rates may reflect changes in routine, with more people staying home or being present in residential areas, potentially deterring thieves who prefer to operate when residents are away at work.

#### Seasonal Trends
![Distribution of Auto Thefts by Season](images/season_occurrence.png)

The seasonal distribution of auto theft shows some variation, though less pronounced than time-of-day patterns:

- **Autumn**: Slight peak (16,492 incidents, 27.0%)
- **Summer**: 15,346 incidents (25.1%)
- **Spring**: 15,060 incidents (24.6%)
- **Winter**: 14,298 incidents (23.3%)

The relatively even distribution suggests that auto theft in Toronto is a year-round problem, though the slight autumn peak may relate to earlier sunset times (extended darkness) before winter weather makes theft operations more difficult.

### Spatial Analysis

#### Neighborhood Hotspots
To identify Toronto neighborhoods with significantly elevated auto theft rates, we computed the mean and standard deviation of theft incidents per 1,000 residents. Neighborhoods exceeding one standard deviation above the mean, i.e., a threshold of 3.29 thefts per 1,000 people, were designated as hotspots.

This data-driven thresholding method identified 18 neighborhoods as theft hotspots. The top-ranked neighborhoods (e.g., 004, 021, 001) exhibit theft rates up to 9.39 per 1,000, far exceeding the city average of 1.96. These areas typically combine high theft counts with either dense populations or disproportionately elevated rates relative to their size. For example, neighborhood 004 reported 417 thefts in a population of just 3,699, indicating a structural vulnerability despite modest absolute numbers.

Based on absolute count of auto theft incidents:

- **West Humber-Clairville (001)**: 4,781 incidents (7.8% of all thefts)
- **Woburn (137)**: 2,243 incidents (3.7%)
- **Milliken (130)**: 1,875 incidents (3.1%)

are top neighborhoods for auto theft, while considering hotspots based on theft rate per 1,000 residents, the top neighborhoods are:

- **Rexdale-Kipling (004)**: 9.39 thefts per 1,000 residents
- **Humber Summit (021)**: 7.54 thefts per 1,000 residents
- **West Humber-Clairville (001)**: 6.70 thefts per 1,000 residents

## Socioeconomics

### Socioeconomic Correlations
To explore the underlying socioeconomic conditions associated with auto theft, we computed pairwise correlations between two key theft metrics, total thefts and theft rate per 1000 people, and a range of census variables covering income, housing, education, employment, transportation, and demographics.

The heatmap below highlights the top 10 variables most correlated with these theft metrics. Notably, `commute_by_car` and `no_degree` are strongly positively correlated with total thefts, while `renter_count`, `postsecondary_education`, and `non_immigrant_count` show moderate negative correlations with theft rate per 1000 people. This suggests that neighborhoods with higher car usage and lower educational attainment experience more theft in absolute terms, while areas with more renters and higher education levels tend to have lower per capita theft rates.

![Heatmap of Top Socioeconomic Correlations with Auto Theft Metrics](images/correlation.png)

To further explore these relationships, we visualized the top 5 variables with the strongest correlations to theft rate per 1000.

![Scatter Plots of Top Socioeconomic Correlations with Theft Rate](images/correlation_scatter.png)

The scatter plots with fitted regression lines reveal that:

- Renter count and postsecondary education are negatively associated with theft rate.
- Commute by car and no degree exhibit slight positive trends with theft rate.
- Non-immigrant count also shows a weak negative correlation.

These trends underscore the multifaceted nature of auto theft patterns and suggest potential intersections with housing stability, access to education, and modes of transportation.

### High vs. Low Theft Neighborhood Comparison
To understand the socioeconomic contrasts between neighborhoods with high and low auto theft rates, we compared the top and bottom quartiles of neighborhoods ranked by theft rate per 1,000 residents. The figure below illustrates the percent difference in selected socioeconomic indicators between these two groups.

![Comparison of High vs Low Theft Rate Neighborhoods](images/high_low_comparison.png)

Notable insights include:

- **Commute by Car**: Substantially higher in high-theft areas (+36.4%), suggesting strong links between vehicle dependency and theft exposure.
- **Postsecondary Education**: Markedly lower in high-theft areas (−32.2%), indicating potential gaps in educational attainment that may correlate with neighborhood risk.
- **Individual Income and Employment Rate**: Both lower in high-theft neighborhoods (−10.9% and −11.3% respectively), despite a small increase in Household Income (+2.5%), possibly due to multigenerational households or combined earners.
- **Unemployment Rate**: Higher in high-theft areas (+9.5%).
- **Immigrant Count**: Slightly higher in high-theft neighborhoods (+6.3%).
- **Transit Usage**: Lower in high-theft neighborhoods (−10.4%).

These contrasting profiles underscore the complex interplay between transportation modes, economic conditions, and auto theft risk, offering guidance for insurers aiming to tailor products and pricing to localized risk patterns.

# Insights and Implications

## Three Key Insights About Auto Theft in Toronto

### Insight 1: Auto Theft Shows Distinct Spatial Concentration Patterns Relevant to Insurance Risk Assessment

Our analysis reveals that auto theft is not randomly distributed across Toronto but shows clear spatial patterns with significant hotspots that directly impact insurance risk assessment. As noted in the "Spatial Analysis," West Humber-Clairville (001) has the highest absolute number of incidents (4,781, or 7.8% of all thefts), while areas like Rexdale-Kipling (004) show the highest theft rate per 1,000 residents. This concentration is critical for insurance risk.

The spatial patterns of auto theft do not simply follow population density. Instead, they appear strongly linked to specific location types (particularly parking lots, as detailed in "Key Finding #4") and neighborhood characteristics. The "High vs. Low Theft Neighborhood Comparison" indicated that high-theft areas have substantially higher rates of commuting by car. The concentration of thefts in specific areas presents both a challenge and an opportunity for insurers – implementing geography-based premium adjustments and targeted policyholder education in these hotspots could significantly improve loss ratios and reduce claim frequency.

### Insight 2: Socioeconomic Factors and Commuting Patterns Intersect to Define Theft Risk

Our analysis points to a nuanced relationship between socioeconomic factors and auto theft. "Key Finding #2" highlighted significant relationships between household income, property values, and auto theft rates, suggesting higher income profiles might experience higher theft rates due to more valuable vehicles. However, the broader correlation analysis in "Analysis Results" reveals a complex picture. For instance, `commute_by_car` and `no_degree` are strongly positively correlated with *total thefts*. Conversely, for *theft rate per 1000 people*, `renter_count` and `postsecondary_education` show moderate negative correlations.

The "High vs. Low Theft Neighborhood Comparison" further illuminates this: high-theft areas exhibit substantially higher `commute_by_car` (+36.4%) and markedly lower `postsecondary_education` (−32.2%). While household income is slightly higher (+2.5%) in these areas, individual income is lower (-10.9%). This complex profile suggests that while vehicle value in certain hotspots (like West Humber-Clairville, which has high income and high thefts) plays a role, factors like high vehicle dependency (indicated by car commuting) and lower educational attainment are also significant indicators of increased theft risk. This implies that auto theft is not solely opportunistic in disadvantaged areas but is also influenced by a combination of vehicle presence, accessibility, and other neighborhood-specific socioeconomic vulnerabilities.

Insurance strategies should therefore consider a multi-faceted risk profile, incorporating not just vehicle value and broad income levels, but also indicators of vehicle usage patterns (like commute mode), housing characteristics (renter concentration), and educational attainment within neighborhoods.

### Insight 3: Parking Environments and 'Outside' Premises are Prime Targets, Especially at Night

Parking environments and 'outside' premises are prime targets for auto theft, with significant implications for insurance. As highlighted in "Key Finding #4," parking lots (both apartment and commercial) account for approximately 35% of incidents. Furthermore, 'Outside' premises, which include streets and other unenclosed areas, constitute the largest category, responsible for a majority of thefts (33,024 incidents, or about 54% of all cleaned thefts). A more detailed breakdown from the data shows streets accounting for about 31.8% and private driveways for 21.2% of thefts. Combined, these common environments represent the vast majority of auto theft locations.

The vulnerability of these locations, particularly parking lots (with 10,642 incidents in apartment lots and 8,331 in commercial lots as per underlying data), underscores the risk in semi-public, less monitored spaces. This, coupled with the temporal pattern ("Key Finding #5") where night hours (10 PM - 6 AM) see the highest theft frequency (37.6% of all thefts), points to clear risk factors. Insurers can leverage these insights for location-based risk assessment, policy endorsements for secure parking, or developing time-sensitive coverage considerations.

## Methodology Details

### Statistical and Actuarial Analysis Methods

- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess relationships between auto theft claim rates and demographic variables for developing rating factors.

- **Spatial Risk Analysis**: Geographic patterns were analyzed using hotspot analysis and kernel density estimation to create territory-based rating zones.

- **Multivariate Regression**: Multiple regression models were constructed to identify the combined impact of various factors on theft claim rates for premium calculation.

- **Risk Tier Clustering**: Neighborhoods were clustered based on theft patterns and demographic characteristics to create homogeneous risk pools for underwriting guidance.

### Data Processing Steps

1. **Auto Theft Processing Pipeline**:
   - Load raw CSV data with optimized dtypes
   - Clean and validate temporal information
   - Standardize geographic information
   - Generate derived features
   - Aggregate by neighborhood

2. **Census Processing Pipeline**:
   - Extract Toronto-specific FSA data
   - Select relevant variables
   - Standardize data types and formats
   - Apply appropriate categorization

3. **Geospatial Integration Pipeline**:
   - Calculate intersection areas between FSAs and neighborhoods
   - Compute area percentages and weights
   - Create FSA-to-neighborhood mapping table
   - Validate spatial relationships

4. **Theft-Census Integration**:
   - Aggregate theft counts by neighborhood
   - Apply spatial weights to census variables
   - Join datasets on neighborhood ID
   - Calculate per capita rates for standardization

### Validation

- **Coordinate Validation**: All claim coordinates were verified to be within Toronto's boundaries (latitude 43.5-44.0, longitude -79.8-79.0) to ensure accurate territorial rating.

- **Claim Logic Checks**: Ensured all theft occurrence dates precede or equal claim report dates to identify potential fraud indicators.

- **Duplicate Claim Detection**: Multiple methods were used to identify and resolve duplicate claim records to prevent double-counting.

- **Imputation Validation**: Imputed values were checked against known patterns and geographic logic to maintain rating equity.

- **Rating Territory Verification**: Maps were generated to visually confirm complete coverage of Toronto's area with appropriate risk differentiation between territories.
